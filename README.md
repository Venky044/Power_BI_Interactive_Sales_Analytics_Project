## Introduction
<a id="introduction"></a>
Welcome to the Power BI Interactive Sales Analytics Project GitHub Repository!

In the Power BI Interactive Sales Analytics Project, I created an interactive dashboard containing 3 pages: Topline performance, product details, and customer details. This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing key metrics and trends in sales, product performance, and customer behavior.

## Data Journey

The data journey began with the foundational steps of cleaning and transforming the raw data, ensuring its readiness for analysis. Subsequently, I established relationships between the various tables to unlock deeper insights into the dataset. Finally, I culminated My efforts in the creation of an interactive dashboard that encapsulates the essence of the data, allowing users to explore and understand its nuances effortlessly.
